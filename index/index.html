        The Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry is registered as a not-for-profit private company limited by guarantee under the Companies Act Chapter 486 of the laws of Kenya. Before the promulgation of the Kenyan Constitution in August 2010, the KNCCI had its main operations at the head office in Nairobi with regional offices in the major towns in Kenya. However, after the promulgation of the constitution, the Chamber amended the legal instrument to establish a National Office and County Chamber’s offices in all the 47 Counties.

          <h3>Hospitality & Entaianment</h3>
        <p>"There are a lot of investment opportunities in tourism in Uganda. One of them, of course, is the accommodation facilities. We require a lot more luxury accommodation facilities in the different parts of the country. We still need more accommodation for tourists in this country in mid-range facilities as well. In terms of the tourism experiences, for example, hiking safaris on the Rwenzori Mountains, having people with the international experience of organizing this kind of service is also where we would require international investors to come in. We have had that investment by an international investor, but we need more of such, like bungee jumping on the Nile,
